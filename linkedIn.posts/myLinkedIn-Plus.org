Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

Previously, I introduced the myLinkedIn package
(https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn), which converts LinkedIn data into
vCards. However, most vCards lack contact info. This info might be available if
you visit a connection's page and click "Contact info."

Building on myLinkedIn-Basic, I've developed "myLinkedIn-Plus" to enrich vCards
with additional contact info via web scraping. While Microsoft-LinkedIn may
prohibit this, many developers find such policies unreasonable.

I have 500+ connections. Less than one-third of my connections' emails are
available through LinkedIn export. On June 8th, I used myLinkedInWeb.cs to
gather contact info for over 400 connections. On June 9th, Microsoft-LinkedIn
banned me for about half a day. A complete transcript of what happened is at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn/tree/main/linkedIn.com-transcript

I explained my actions and requested clarification on the Microsoft-LinkedIn
policies. I received no reply, but my account was unbanned after less than 10
hours.

Microsoft-LinkedIn's lack of response prompted me to write an Open Letter
requesting clarification. Here is a link to that Open Letter: NOTYET

/Warnings About Use of myLinkedInWeb.cs Software/

myLinkedInWeb.cs is a web scraper limited to a narrow scope. Microsoft-LinkedIn
may consider its use a violation of their User Agreement, risking account
restrictions.

The software comes AS IS with no warranties. Use it at your own risk.

This post is part of a series. A roadmap is availabled at:\\

By adopting myLinkedIn, you can enjoy an autonomous interaction model that
respects your privacy outside LinkedIn. Please share this tool widely if you
find it useful.

At your service,
