Micorsoft-LinkedIn Open Letter: Requesting Inclusion of Our Connections' Contact-Info in Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip

Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

Here is the text of an open letter to Micorsoft-LinkedIn requesting inclusion of our connections' contact-info in Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip.

-------

I, Mohsen Banan, joined LinkedIn on January 19, 2006. My view and use of
LinkedIn at that time was that of a model of "Business Cards Exchange" -- with
colleagues, friends and family. I would access my connection's Contact-Info
(email-address, phone number) and then interact with them *outside* of LinkedIn.
Let's call that "LinkingOut". This LinkingOut end-to-end model of interactions
is quite important for many of us (LinkedIn members).

I have put together a python package called "myLinkedIn" --
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn. It converts the LinkedIn exported data
into a collection of vCards. One for each of your connections. These vCards can
then be optionally augmented by the Contact-Info of your connections. This takes
us back to the model of "Business Cards Exchange".

You can obtain a snap shot of your current connections data at LinkedIn. There
it says: "Your LinkedIn data belongs to you, and you can download an archive any
time ..." and that is kind of true, but Micorsoft-LinkedIn's intent is something
else.

LinkedIn provides you a bounch of .csv (comma-separated values) files. These
.csv files are realy not all that useful by themselves. The primary abstraction
of LinkedIn are "Connections" in a "Business Cards Exchange" model. So, the
myLinkedIn package combines the information that LinkedIn provides in .csv
files.

Unfortunately, the information that Microsoft-LinkedIn provides in its export
data is incomplete. And, this is a request from Micorsoft-LinkedIn for
addressing that problem.

One of the files that LinkedIn provides is Connections.csv, top of that file
reads.

"When exporting your connection data, you may notice that some of the email
addresses are missing. You will only see email addresses for connections who
have allowed their connections to see or download their email address using this
setting https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy/email. You can learn more
here https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/261"

This is where LinkedIn policies start to violate the "Business Cards Exchange"
model. In the "Setting--Visibility--Who can see or download your email address"
the defaults are: "Only visible to me" and "Don't Allow connections to export
emails."

It seems like Micorsoft-LinkedIn wants us to be "locked in" so that people use
more of "LinkedIn Messaging" and less of external email.

The defaults should be "1st degree connections" and "Allow connections to export
emails" should be always on.

The export option is silly because if I can see my connection's Contact-Info,
then I can retrieve it myself, in which case consistent with the "Business Cards
Exchange" model it is reasonable for me to capture automation of that.
And this is what myLinkedIn-Plus does. I used
myLinkedInWeb.cs to web-scrape and add my own connection's Contact-Info
to my LinkedIn vCards.
 On June 9th,Micorsoft-LinkedIn banned me for about half a day.
A complete transcript of what happened is at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn/tree/main/linkedIn.com-transcript

There, I explained all of this and asked for clarifications and got no replies.

So, the crux of the matter is: does Micorsoft-LinkedIn want to honor the
"Business Cards Exchange" for LinkingOut or does Micorsoft-LinkedIn want to lock
us in towards becoming another commercial American social network.
