About the myLinkedIn-Basic Package --- vCards for ALL of Your LinkedIn Connections

June, 16, 2025 --- Mohsen Banan --- linkedin@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net

Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

I have put together a python package called "myLinkedIn". It converts your
LinkedIn data into a collection of vCards. One for each of your connections.
These vCards can then be optionally augmented by the Contact-Info of your
connections. You can then import these vCards to your usage environemnt (e.g.,
Emacs ebdb, MS Outlook Contacts, Google Contacts). You can then privately
tag/categorize your connections.

You can obtain a snap shot of your current connections data at LinkedIn.
Click the “Me” icon, then select “Settings & Privacy” from the dropdown menu.
Then Go to Data Privacy and click “Data privacy” and then "Get a copy of your data".

There it says: "Your LinkedIn data belongs to you, and you can download an
archive any time ..." and that is kind of true.

LinkedIn provides you a bounch of .csv (comma-separated values) files. These
.csv files are realy not all that useful. The primary abstraction of LinkedIn
are "Connections" in a "Business Cards Exchange" model. So, the myLinkedIn
package combines the information that LinkedIn provides in .csv files.

But unfortunately that information is not complete.
One of the files that LinkedIn provides is Connections.csv top of that file

"When exporting your connection data, you may notice that some of the email
addresses are missing. You will only see email addresses for connections who
have allowed their connections to see or download their email address using this
setting https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy/email. You can learn more
here https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/261"

In my case less than one-third of them included an email. We address this
short-coming with myLinkedIn-Plus -- which involves some web scraping.

The complete sources and instructions for using the myLinkedIn package are at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn. Here, I include a summary for the
instructions for the impatient:

- Install the myLinkedIn package --- pipx install bisos.myLinkedIn
- Obtain the Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip file from LinkedIn --- See above
- Run:  myLinkedIn.cs to see a menu of what is supported.
- Run: myLinkedIn.cs --myLinkedInBase="~/Downloads"  -i fullUpdate ~/Downloads/Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip
- In your ~/Downloads, you will see the following additional dirs: LinkedInDataExport VCards maildir
- You can then import the vCards in ~/Downloads/VCards to your usage environment (outlook, google contacts)
