/An Overview of myLinkedIn and LinkingOut ---Facilitating a vCards Based Edge-to-Edge Interactions Model/

Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

I oppose the commercial American model of social media, which is why I avoid
platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. I've used LinkedIn for about 20
years, joining on January 19, 2006, viewing it as a tool for "Business Cards
Exchange" with colleagues, friends, and family. I accessed my connections'
contact info (email, phone) to interact with them *outside* LinkedIn, a process
I call "LinkingOut." This end-to-end model is more private than LinkedIn's
native model, where I only share public professional info.

Over the years, Microsoft's LinkedIn has shifted towards a commercial
exploitative model. I aim to preserve the "Business Cards Exchange" model of
LinkingOut. To achieve this, I developed a Python package called "myLinkedIn,"
which converts LinkedIn data into vCards for each connection. These vCards can
be augmented with contact info and imported into environments like Emacs EBDB,
MS Outlook, or Google Contacts, allowing private tagging and categorization.

Complete sources and instructions for the myLinkedIn package are at:
[[https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn]].

For "LinkedIn Posts," I use the MTDT package (Mail Templating and Distribution
and Tracking) [[https://github.com/bx-blee/mtdt]] to communicate with connections
via email. This way my posts and interactions are not at the mercy of LinkedIn
algorithms. This is what I call "LinkingOut." LinkingOut is not instead of
LinkedIn, it is in addition to it.

Following this overview, I'll post a series of related articles, concluding with
an Open Letter to Microsoft-LinkedIn, urging them not to hinder our "Business
Cards Exchange" model. Here's a summary of those posts:
