Micorsoft-LinkedIn Open Letter: Requesting Inclusion of Our Connections' Contact-Info in Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip

June, 16, 2025 --- Mohsen Banan --- linkedin@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net

Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

Here is the text of an open letter to Micorsoft-LinkedIn requesting inclusion of our connections' contact-info in Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip.

-------

I, Mohsen Banan, joined LinkedIn on January 19, 2006. My view and use of
LinkedIn at that time was that of a "Business Cards Exchange" with colleagues,
friends and family. I would access my Connection's Contact-Info (email-address,
phone number) and then interact with them *outside* of LinkedIn. Let's call that
"LinkingOut". This LinkingOut end-to-end model of interactions is
quite important for many of us (LinkedIn members).

I have put together a python package called "myLinkedIn". It converts your
LinkedIn data into a collection of vCards. One for each of your connections.
These vCards can then be optionally augmented by the Contact-Info of your
connections.

The complete sources and instructions for using the myLinkedIn package are at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn.


In a previous post (NOTYET), I introduced the myLinkedIn python package
--https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn. It converts
your LinkedIn data into a collection of vCards. Unfortunately, based on the data
that LinkedIn exports, most of your connections' vCard lack their Contact-Info.
However, your connection's Contact-Info may actually be available to you. If you
were to go to your connection's home page and click on "Contact info", you may
see their Contact-Info including Email, Websites, Phone, Address and IM
information.

The information that Microsoft-LinkedIn provides in its export data is
incomplete and not very useful. This is about addressing that problem.

So, in such a situation, the expected thinking of a software developer is
obvious: I'll write a web scraper to get the Contact-Info of my own
connections. To the extent that Microsoft-LinkedIn may consider that
prohibited, most developers would consider Microsoft-LinkedIn's policy
unreasonable and unfair.

I have done so. Layer-2 of myLinkedIn is myLinkedIn-Plus. You can use
myLinkedInWeb.cs to web-scrape and add your own connection's Contact-Info
to your LinkedIn vCards.
 On June 9th, I continued
and shortly thereafter, Micorsoft-LinkedIn banned me.
A complete transcript of what happened is at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn/tree/main/linkedIn.com-transcript

I went ahead and fully explained what I am doing. I explained why I consider
what I am doing reasonable and asked them to clarify the User Agreement and
their AUP with respect to my specific use. I got no reply and no clarification
but the restrictions on my account were removed. I was unbanned. In total,
my login to LinkedIn was banned for less than 10 hours.

The fact that Micorsoft-LinkedIn did not respond to my request for
clarification, bothers me. So, I have written an Open Letter to
Micorsoft-LinkedIn requesting clarifications. Here is a link to that
Open Letter.

You can obtain a snap shot of your current connections data at LinkedIn.
Click the “Me” icon, then select “Settings & Privacy” from the dropdown menu.
Then Go to Data Privacy and click “Data privacy” and then "Get a copy of your data".

There it says: "Your LinkedIn data belongs to you, and you can download an
archive any time ..." and that is kind of true.

LinkedIn provides you a bounch of .csv (comma-separated values) files. These
.csv files are realy not all that useful. The primary abstraction of LinkedIn
are "Connections" in a "Business Cards Exchange" model. So, the myLinkedIn
package combines the information that LinkedIn provides in .csv files.

But unfortunately that information is not complete.
One of the files that LinkedIn provides is Connections.csv top of that file

"When exporting your connection data, you may notice that some of the email
addresses are missing. You will only see email addresses for connections who
have allowed their connections to see or download their email address using this
setting https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy/email. You can learn more
here https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/261"

In my case less than one-third of them included an email. We address this
short-coming with myLinkedIn-Plus -- which involves some web scraping.
