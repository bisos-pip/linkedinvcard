I oppose the commercial American model of social media, which is why I steer
clear of platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. I've been using
LinkedIn since January 19, 2006, viewing it primarily as a "Business Cards
Exchange" with colleagues, friends, and family. My approach involves accessing
my connections' contact information (email, phone) to interact with them *outside*
of LinkedIn, a method I refer to as "LinkingOut." This end-to-end model offers
more privacy than LinkedIn's native messaging  model.

Over the years, LinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft, has increasingly aligned with
the traditional exploitative model of American social media. I am committed to
maintaining the "Business Cards Exchange" model through LinkingOut. To support
this, I developed a Python package called "myLinkedIn," which transforms
LinkedIn data into vCards for each connection. These vCards can be enriched with
additional contact information and imported into environments like Emacs EBDB,
MS Outlook, or Google Contacts, enabling private tagging and categorization. For
"LinkedIn Posts," I employ the MTDT package (Mail Templating, Distribution, and
Tracking) to communicate with connections via email, thus bypassing LinkedIn's
algorithm. This is the essence of "LinkingOut."

On June 8th, I ran myLinkedInWeb.cs on my own connections in multiple batches
and obtained the contact information of more than 400 of my connections. On June
9th, I continued this process but was shortly thereafter banned by
Microsoft-LinkedIn for half a day. A complete transcript of what occurred
follows:

* June 8, 2025 -- Run of myLinkedInWeb.cs on  400 Connections

Ran these in batches of 50, 100, and 200 on the evening of June 8th.
No problems. Ran as expected.

* June 9, 2025 -- Run of myLinkedInWeb.cs on  the Remaining 190 Connections

Ran the remaining 190 or so connections in a single batch at around 8:00 am on June 9th.
70 of them worked fine. Then my account was restricted.

* Restriction Periods

First I was restricted till about 10:00 am.

Next I received a notice saying:

#+begin_src text
Your account is temporarily restricted

We’ve restricted your account until June 09, 2025 6:50 PM PDT because we
detected the use of software that automates activity. To protect our members’
privacy and help foster authentic interactions on LinkedIn, our User Agreement
prohibits the use of these tools.

Please review any tools you’re using to access LinkedIn and remove any automated
software. If you’d like to provide us with more details about your account so we
can further assist you, contact us.

I then used the "contact us" link.

LinkedIn doesn’t allow the use of third party software or browser extensions
that automate activities on LinkedIn. If you think your account is restricted by
mistake, let us know why:

---

I am not using any third party software or browser extensions. I have been using
LinkedIn for more the 20 (twenty) years to stay connected to my colleagues. I
want to have current information (email/phone-nu) for ALL of my connections.
Last night and this morning, I went through the "Contact Info"of my own first
level connections to update my address book (vCards). I used my own software
(not third part) to obtain this information. I believe such use falls in the
fair and reasonable category. If LinkedIn considers this use not acceptable,
then it should include the Contact info of ALL of my connections in
Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip. Does LinkedIn really expect me to keep my vCards
current manually? If you consider what I have done unreasonable, please
unrestrict my account and let me know. Knowing these details, if you ask me to
not use my own tools any more, I will comply and not use them anymore.

---

To improve your LinkedIn experience, please list the third-party programs,
services or plug-ins you currently use to automate activity on LinkedIn.


---

I am not using any third party software. I am using my own software. My own
software is called "MyLinkedIn". At github it is at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn At PYPI it is at:
https://pypi.org/project/bisos.myLinkedIn/. You can install it with: pipx
install bisos.myLinkedIn. The software is well documented. Layer-1
(myLinkedIn.cs) uses do not violate LinkedIn policies in any way. Layer-2, does
web scrape contact info of my first level connections and adds them to vCards of
Layer-1. In my view such usage for my own connections is fair and reasonable. If
you say that I should not have ALL of my own first level contact info
conveniently, then I shall comply and stop using my own software. I know that
some contact info is in Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip, but I don't consider that
sufficient. Please Un Restrict my account and in specific to my usage and this
software clarify LinkedIn policy and standing. Again, if you requite that I
should not use this software, I shall comply.

---

We may temporarily remove the restriction on your account as we review your activity and responses.
