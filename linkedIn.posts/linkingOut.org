Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

Being human involves social interactions, and the digital era is here. However,
that doesn't mean we should buy into the commercial model of American social
media.

The American digital ecosystem is fundamentally flawed, based on the Western
Intellectual Property Rights regime, leading to corporate exploitation and
surveillance capitalism. These issues can't be fixed with band-aids or evolved
realistically. We need an alternative.

There is a blueprint for an alternative: ByStar (By*). ByStar challenges the
existing proprietary American digital ecosystem while operating concurrently
alongside it. ByStar's primary offerings are tangible autonomy and genuine
privacy on a large scale. ByStar represents a moral inversion of the proprietary
American internet services model. By* is about the redecentralization of
internet application services and is inherently edge-oriented. Recently, I
authored a book outlining an interdisciplinary blueprint for the realization of
ByStar.

Basis for Abolishment of the Western Intellectual Property Rights Regime
And Introduction of the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem

ByStar focuses on the abstraction of the individual on the autonomous edge, as
opposed to the controlled American center.

The "Business Cards Exchange" model of LinkedIn lets us create networks of
connections. Using the myLinkedIn package --
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn -- we can extract the abstraction of our
LinkedIn connections as vCards.

In ByStar, we can import these vCards to the ByStar usage environment
(Blee-Contacts). We can privately tag/categorize our LinkedIn connections. For
the equivalent of a "LinkedIn Post," we can use the MTDT (Mail Templating and
Distribution and Tracking) package -- https://github.com/bx-blee/mtdt -- to
engage in social network-like (mass communications) interactions with our
LinkedIn connections through email (outside of LinkedIn). This way, my posts
are not at the mercy of LinkedIn's algorithm. This is what we call "LinkingOut."
For LinkingOut, my outgoing ByName email address is
linkedout@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net, and my incoming ByName email address is
linkedin@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net. My ByName autonomous edge is: http://mohsen.1.banan.byname.net

There you have it: a practical blueprint for healthy social networking.
Furthermore, note that LinkingOut is not instead of LinkedIn; it is in addition
to LinkedIn.

This post is part of a series. A roadmap is availabled at:\\
