About the myLinkedIn-Plus Package --- Enriching Your vCards With Your Connections' Contact-Info

June, 16, 2025 --- Mohsen Banan --- linkedin@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net

Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

In a previous post (NOTYET), I introduced the myLinkedIn python package
--https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn. It converts
your LinkedIn data into a collection of vCards. Unfortunately, based on the data
that LinkedIn exports, most of your connections' vCard lack their Contact-Info.
However, your connection's Contact-Info may actually be available to you. If you
were to go to your connection's home page and click on "Contact info", you may
see their Contact-Info including Email, Websites, Phone, Address and IM
information.

The information that Microsoft-LinkedIn provides in its export data is
incomplete and not very useful. This is about addressing that problem.

So, in such a situation, the expected thinking of a software developer is
obvious: I'll write a web scraper to get the Contact-Info of my own
connections. To the extent that Microsoft-LinkedIn may consider that
prohibited, most developers would consider Microsoft-LinkedIn's policy
unreasonable and unfair.

I have done so. Layer-2 of myLinkedIn is myLinkedIn-Plus. You can use
myLinkedInWeb.cs to web-scrape and add your own connection's Contact-Info
to your LinkedIn vCards.

I have 500+ connections. Less than one-third on my own connections' email
addresses are available through the LinkedIn export. On June 8th, I run
myLinkedInWeb.cs on my own connections in multiple batches and got the
Contact-Info of more than 400 of my connections. On June 9th, I continued
and shortly thereafter, Micorsoft-LinkedIn banned me.
A complete transcript of what happened is at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn/tree/main/linkedIn.com-transcript

I went ahead and fully explained what I am doing. I explained why I consider
what I am doing reasonable and asked them to clarify the User Agreement and
their AUP with respect to my specific use. I got no reply and no clarification
but the restrictions on my account were removed. I was unbanned. In total,
my login to LinkedIn was banned for less than 10 hours.

The fact that Micorsoft-LinkedIn did not respond to my request for
clarification, bothers me. So, I have written an Open Letter to
Micorsoft-LinkedIn requesting clarifications. Here is a link to that
Open Letter.


*** Warnings About Use of myLinkedInWeb.cs Software ***

myLinkedInWeb.cs software is a web automation tool (a web scraper)
limited to a very narrow scope of information gathering. Yet, Microsoft-LinkedIn
may consider such use as in violation of their User Agreement, and your access
to LinkedIn may be restricted.

myLinkedIn package's myLinkedInWeb.cs software comes AS IS with no warranties of
any sort. If you use it, you are on your own. If you get banned, it is not my
fault or the software's fault.
