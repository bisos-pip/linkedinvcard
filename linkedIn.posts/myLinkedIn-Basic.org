About the myLinkedIn-Basic Package --- vCards for ALL of Your LinkedIn Connections

Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

I've developed a Python package called "myLinkedIn" that converts your LinkedIn
data into a collection of vCards, one for each connection. These vCards can be
optionally enriched with your connections' contact info. You can import these
vCards into your usage environment (e.g., Emacs ebdb, MS Outlook Contacts,
Google Contacts) and privately tag or categorize your connections.

To obtain a snapshot of your current connections' data on LinkedIn, click the
“Me” icon, select “Settings & Privacy” from the dropdown menu, go to Data
Privacy, and click “Data privacy” then "Get a copy of your data". LinkedIn
states: "Your LinkedIn data belongs to you, and you can download an archive any
time..." which is somewhat true.

LinkedIn provides a bunch of .csv (comma-separated values) files. These .csv
files aren't very useful on their own. The primary abstraction of LinkedIn is
"Connections" in a "Business Cards Exchange" model. The myLinkedIn package
combines the information LinkedIn provides in .csv files.

Unfortunately, the information is incomplete. One of the files LinkedIn provides
is Connections.csv. At the top of that file, it reads: "When exporting your
connection data, you may notice that some of the email addresses are missing.
You will only see email addresses for connections who have allowed their
connections to see or download their email address using this setting
https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy/email. You can learn more here
https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/261"

In my case, less than one-third included an email. We address this shortcoming
with myLinkedIn-Plus, which involves some web scraping.

Complete sources and instructions for using the myLinkedIn package are at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn. Here’s a quick guide for the impatient:

- Install the myLinkedIn package: pipx install bisos.myLinkedIn
- Obtain the Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip file from LinkedIn (see above)
- Run: myLinkedIn.cs to see a menu of what is supported.
- Run: myLinkedIn.cs --myLinkedInBase="~/Downloads" -i fullUpdate ~/Downloads/Basic_LinkedInDataExport.zip
- In your ~/Downloads, you will see additional directories: LinkedInDataExport, VCards, maildir
- You can then import the vCards in ~/Downloads/VCards to your usage environment (Outlook, Google Contacts, ebdb)

The use of myLinkedIn-Basic (myLinkedIn.cs) does not violate LinkedIn policies in any way.
