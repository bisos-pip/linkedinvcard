Dear Microsoft-LinkedIn Acceptable-Use Policy Maker,

I, Mohsen Banan, joined LinkedIn on January 19, 2006, viewing it as a "Business
Cards Exchange" model. I would access my connections' contact info (email,
phone) to interact with them *outside* of LinkedIn, a process I callx
"LinkingOut." This model is crucial for many LinkedIn members.

I developed a Python package called "myLinkedIn" --
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn. It converts LinkedIn exported data into
vCards, one for each connection, optionally augmented with contact info.

LinkedIn members can obtain a snapshot of their current connections' data on
LinkedIn. The download request page states: "Your LinkedIn data belongs to you,
and you can download an archive any time..." which is somewhat true, but
unfortunately, the information Microsoft-LinkedIn provides in its export data is
incomplete. This is a request to Microsoft-LinkedIn to address that problem.

One of the files LinkedIn provides is Connections.csv. At the top, it reads:
"When exporting your connection data, you may notice that some of the email
addresses are missing. You will only see email addresses for connections who
have allowed their connections to see or download their email address using this
setting https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy/email. You can learn more
here https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/261"

This is where LinkedIn policies start to violate the "Business Cards Exchange"
model. In "Setting--Visibility--Who can see or download your email address,"
the defaults are: "Only visible to me" and "Don't Allow connections to export
emails."

It seems Microsoft-LinkedIn wants us "locked in" so people use more "LinkedIn
Messaging" and less external email.

The defaults should be "1st degree connections" and "Allow connections to export
emails" should always be on.

The export option is unnecessary because if I can see my connection's contact
info, I can retrieve it myself, making it reasonable to automate that. This is
what myLinkedIn-Plus does. I used myLinkedInWeb.cs to web-scrape and added my own
connection's contact info to my LinkedIn vCards. On June 9th, Microsoft-LinkedIn
banned me for about half a day. A complete transcript of what happened is at:
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn/tree/main/linkedIn.com-transcript

I explained all of this and asked for clarifications but got no replies.

So, the crux of the matter is: does Microsoft-LinkedIn want to honor the
"Business Cards Exchange" for LinkingOut, or does it want to lock us in towards
LinkedIn becoming another exploitation-oriented American social network?
