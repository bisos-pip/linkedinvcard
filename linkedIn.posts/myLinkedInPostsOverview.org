Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

I oppose the commercial exploitation-oriented American model of social media,
which is why I avoid platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. I've used
LinkedIn for about 20 years, joining on January 19, 2006, viewing it as a tool
for "Business Cards Exchange" with colleagues, friends, and family. I would
access my connections' contact info (email, phone) to interact with them
*outside* LinkedIn, a process I call "LinkingOut." This end-to-end model is more
private than LinkedIn's native "Messaging" model.

Over the years, Microsoft's LinkedIn has shifted towards a commercial
exploitation-oriented model. I aim to preserve the "Business Cards Exchange"
model of LinkingOut. To achieve this, I developed a Python package called
"myLinkedIn," which converts LinkedIn data into vCards for each connection.
These vCards can be augmented with contact info and imported into environments
like Emacs ebdb, MS Outlook, or Google Contacts, allowing private tagging and
categorization.

Complete sources and instructions for the myLinkedIn package are at:
[[https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn]].

For "LinkedIn Posts," I use the MTDT package (Mail Templating and Distribution
and Tracking) -- [[https://github.com/bx-blee/mtdt]] -- to communicate with
connections via email. This way my posts and interactions are not at the mercy
of LinkedIn algorithem. LinkingOut is not instead of LinkedIn, it is in addition
to LinkedIn.

Following this overview, I'll post a series of related articles, concluding with
an Open Letter to Microsoft-LinkedIn, urging them not to hinder our "Business
Cards Exchange" model. Here's a summary of those posts:
