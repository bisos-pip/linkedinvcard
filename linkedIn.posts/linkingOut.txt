LinkingOut: Healthy Edge-to-Edge Social Media Interactions Outside of LinkedIn

June, 16, 2025 --- Mohsen Banan --- linkedin@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net

Dear Fellow LinkedIn Member,

Being human involves social interactions and the digital era is here.
But, that does not mean that we should buy into the commercial model of American social media.

As a whole, the model of American digital ecosystem is corrupt. It is based on
the flawed Western Intellectual Property Rights regime. It leads to exploitation
of individuals by corporations. It takes us to surveailance capitalism. These
can't be fixed by bandaids and these can't realistically be evolved. We need and
an alternative.

There is a blueprint for an alternative. We call it ByStar (By*).
ByStar challenges the existing proprietary American digital ecosystem while
operating concurrently alongside it. ByStar's primary offerings are tangible
autonomy and genuine privacy on a very large scale. ByStar represents a moral
inversion of the proprietary American internet services model. By* is about
redecentralization of internet application services. By* is inherently edge
oriented. Recently, I authored a book outlining an interdisciplinary blueprint
for the realization of ByStar.

Basis for Abolishment of the Western Intellectual Property Rights Regime
And Introduction of the Libre-Halaal ByStar Digital Ecosystem

ByStar focuses on the abstraction of the individual on the autonomous edge -- as
opposed to the controlled American center.

The "Business Cards Exchange" model of LinkedIn let's us create networks of
connections. Using the myLinkedIn package --
https://github.com/bisos-pip/myLinkedIn -- we can then extract the abstraction
of our LinkedIn connections as vCards.

In ByStar we can then import these vCards to the ByStar usage environemnt
(Blee-Contacts). We can then privately tag/categorize our LinkedIn connections.
For the equivalent of a "LinkedIn Post", we can then use the MTDT (Mail Templating
and Distribution and Tracking) package -- https://github.com/bx-blee/mtdt -- to
engage in social network like (mass communications) interactions with our
LinkedIn connections through email (outside of LinkedIn). This way my "posts"
are not at the mercy of LinkedIn algorithem. This is what we call "LinkingOut".
For LinkingOut, my outgoing ByName email address is linkedout@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net
and my incoming ByName email address is linkedin@mohsen.1.banan.byname.net.

There you have it. A practical blueprint for healthy social networking.
Furthermore note that LinkingOut is not instead of LinkedIn, it is in addition
to LinkedIn.
